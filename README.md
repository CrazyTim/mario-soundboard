# Mario Soundboard

An unofficial sound-effects app. I made it so my kids could have more immersion when playing the [Monopoly Gamer board game](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/06/mario-themed-monopoly-gamerhas-power-ups-and-boss-battles). Collecting coins from the bank has never sounded so good!

Its a great showcase of the amazing sounds and characters of the Mario franchise.
