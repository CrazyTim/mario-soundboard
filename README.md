# Mario Soundboard

A fun unofficial sound-effects app. I made this so my kids could have sound-effects and music when playing the [Monopoly Gamer board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230408/monopoly-gamer). Collecting coins from the bank has never sounded so good!

Its a small showcase of the amazing sounds and icons of the Mario franchise.
