## new features:
- New sounds:
  - does the banana in mario kart have a drop sound?
  - thwomp 'stomp'.
  - star coin.
  - floor switch.
- 'Stop all' button.
- Allow user to switch between different game modes (tags on items). Only show sounds from certain games. Each game mode can have its own rules, eg: when play star, stop music, but only if not Mario kart mode.

## issues:
- Initial load is slow.
- Missing icons.
- Rosalina sounds are too quiet compared to the others.
- Should combine 'game over' music and the 'death' sound effect?
- Can't play .ogg files on safari. Howler recommends webm and mp3.
  - Change all .oog files to mp3.
  - Then make a second copy of all sounds as webm using [ffmpeg](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#format-recommendations)
