## new features:
- new sounds:
  - does the banana in mario kart have a drop sound?
  - thwomp 'stomp'.
  - star coin.
  - floor switch.
- music items should show how much time is remaining - animate a svg circular progress line inside the circle border.
- group sounds into playlists.
- give items hidden 'tags', and add ability to filter on tags.

## issues:
- missing icons
- rosalina sounds are too quiet compared to the others
- should combine 'game over' music and the 'death' sound effect?
- convert all sounds from mp3 to webM (?) (so they don't have blank space at the beginning).
