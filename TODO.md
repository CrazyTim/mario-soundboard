## new features:
- new sounds:
  - does the banana in mario kart have a drop sound?
  - thwomp 'stomp'.
  - star coin.
  - floor switch.
- Stop all button.
- Allow user to switch between different game modes (tags on items). Only show sounds from certain games. Each game mode can have its own rules, eg: when play star, stop music, but only if not Mario kart mode.

## issues:
- initial load is slow.
- missing icons.
- rosalina sounds are too quiet compared to the others.
- should combine 'game over' music and the 'death' sound effect?
- probably can't play .oog files on safari
